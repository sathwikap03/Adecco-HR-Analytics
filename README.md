##  Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition trends** at **Adecco India** to identify key factors influencing turnover among junior sales employees.  
The goal is to develop **data-driven insights** that support HR teams in improving employee **retention**, **engagement**, and **satisfaction**.

The entire analysis was performed using **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging formulas, PivotTables, charts, and KPI visualizations.  
An **interactive HR dashboard** was built to summarize key metrics and insights.

##  Dataset
**File:** "Adecco_Attrition_Analysis.xlsx"  
**Source:** Simulated HRIS dataset for Adecco India

- Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
- Employment details (Department, Job Role, Years at Company)
- Compensation and benefits (Monthly Income, Stock Options)
- Work conditions (OverTime, DistanceFromHome, WorkLifeBalance)
- Performance and satisfaction metrics (Performance Rating, Job Satisfaction)

##  Tools & Techniques Used
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - PivotTables & PivotCharts  
  - Formulas: 'COUNTIF', 'AVERAGE', 'CORREL', 'IF'

  - Slicers for interactivity  
  - Conditional Formatting  

##  Project Workflow

###  Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Verified and formatted categorical data (Attrition, Gender, Department, etc.)
- Removed inconsistencies in numerical fields like Income and Age  
- Created calculated columns for attrition metrics and rates  

Explored fundamental HR metrics such as:
- Overall **attrition rate**
- **Department-wise** attrition
- **Age** and **income** patterns of employees who left
- **Gender-based** attrition comparison
- **Job satisfaction** by role  
- **Overtime** trends and **average tenure**

Performed deeper analytics using correlations and relationships:
- Identified **top three factors** contributing to attrition  
- Explored **job involvement**, **training**, and **marital status** impact  
- Analyzed **work-life balance vs. performance**  
- Studied **tenure vs. job satisfaction** and **stock options vs. attrition**
